# INFO670

The Gallery App developed for INFO 670 showcases a sophisticated mobile application with an intuitive user interface and seamless navigation. The app features three primary screens: a Gallery screen displaying a collection of pictures with thumbnails and captions, an Image Viewing screen for viewing full-sized images, and a Profile screen where users can view and edit their profile information. The Gallery screen utilizes a scrollable grid layout for easy browsing, and images can be tapped to view them in detail on the Image Viewing screen, which includes a back button for navigation. The Profile screen includes text inputs, a dropdown menu, and a toggle switch, ensuring a comprehensive user experience. User data is persistently stored using AsyncStorage, allowing profile information to be saved and retrieved even after the app is closed and reopened. The app employs React Native and the Ionicons library for icons, with custom styling to ensure a visually appealing interface.
